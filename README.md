 Hello, World!
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a code enthusiast, always exploring new ways to make things better, faster, and sometimes just a bit weirder 🤓. Here, you'll find a mix of experiments, projects, and whatever side quest I’m on this week.

🌱 Learning: Constantly building my knowledge toolkit—dabbles in AI, backend logic, and a sprinkle of front-end magic.
🛠️ Tinkering: Obsessed with clean code, creative solutions, and breaking things (in the name of progress).
💡 Collaborate: Open to contributions, ideas, and shared adventures.
Feel free to explore, fork, or just say hi!
